static → Default, stays in normal order (no movement).

relative → Stays in order, but you can move it a little from its spot.

absolute → Breaks out of order, placed exactly where you set it inside parent.

fixed → Stays stuck on screen when you scroll.

sticky → Moves like relative, but sticks to the screen when scrolling past a point.(You can’t mix both axes at the same time.)
